DatacenterBroker
================

.. java:package:: org.cloudbus.cloudsim.brokers
   :noindex:

.. java:type:: public interface DatacenterBroker extends SimEntity

   Represents a broker acting on behalf of a cloud customer. It hides VM management such as vm creation, submission of cloudlets to VMs and destruction of VMs.

   A broker implements the policies for selecting a VM to run a Cloudlet and a Datacenter to run the submitted VMs.

Fields
------
DEF_VM_DESTRUCTION_DELAY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:field::  double DEF_VM_DESTRUCTION_DELAY
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   A default delay value to indicate that \ **NO**\  VM should be immediately destroyed after becoming idle.

   This is used as the default value returned by the \ :java:ref:`getVmDestructionDelayFunction()`\  if a \ :java:ref:`Function`\  is not set.

   **See also:** :java:ref:`.setVmDestructionDelayFunction(Function)`

LOGGER
^^^^^^

.. java:field::  Logger LOGGER
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

NULL
^^^^

.. java:field::  DatacenterBroker NULL
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   An attribute that implements the Null Object Design Pattern for \ :java:ref:`DatacenterBroker`\  objects.

Methods
-------
addOnVmsCreatedListener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method::  DatacenterBroker addOnVmsCreatedListener(EventListener<DatacenterBrokerEventInfo> listener)
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   Adds an \ :java:ref:`EventListener`\  that will be notified every time VMs in the waiting list are all created.

   Events are fired according to the following conditions:

   ..

   * if all VMs are submitted before the simulation start and all those VMs are created after starting, then the event will be fired just once, during all simulation execution, for every registered Listener;
   * if all VMs submitted at a given time cannot be created due to lack of suitable Hosts, the event will not be fired for that submission;
   * if new VMs are submitted during simulation execution, the event may be fired multiple times. For instance, consider new VMs are submitted during simulation execution at times 10 and 20. If for every submission time, all VMs could be created, then every Listener will be notified 2 times (one for VMs submitted at time 10 and other for those at time 20).

   :param listener: the Listener that will be notified

   **See also:** :java:ref:`.getVmWaitingList()`

bindCloudletToVm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method::  boolean bindCloudletToVm(Cloudlet cloudlet, Vm vm)
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   Specifies that an already submitted cloudlet, which is in the \ :java:ref:`waiting list <getCloudletWaitingList()>`\ , must run in a specific virtual machine.

   :param cloudlet: the cloudlet to be bind to a given Vm
   :param vm: the vm to bind the Cloudlet to
   :return: true if the Cloudlet was found in the waiting list and was bind to the given Vm, false it the Cloudlet was not found in such a list (that may mean it wasn't submitted yet or was already created)

setCloudletComparator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method::  void setCloudletComparator(Comparator<Cloudlet> comparator)
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

.. java:method::  void setDatacenterSupplier(Supplier<Datacenter> datacenterSupplier)
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   Sets the \ :java:ref:`Supplier`\  that selects and returns a Datacenter to place submitted VMs.

   The supplier defines the policy to select a Datacenter to host a VM that is waiting to be created.

   :param datacenterSupplier: the datacenterSupplier to set

setFallbackDatacenterSupplier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method::  void setFallbackDatacenterSupplier(Supplier<Datacenter> fallbackDatacenterSupplier)

   The supplier defines the policy to select a Datacenter to host a VM when all VM creation requests were received but not all VMs could be created. In this case, a different Datacenter has to be selected to request the creation of the remaining VMs in the waiting list.

   :param fallbackDatacenterSupplier: the fallbackDatacenterSupplier to set

setVmComparator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method::  void setVmComparator(Comparator<Vm> comparator)
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   :param comparator: the VM Comparator to set

setVmDestructionDelay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method::  DatacenterBroker setVmDestructionDelay(double delay)
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   Sets the delay after which an idle VM should be destroyed. Using such a method defines the same delay for any VM that becomes idle. If you need to define different delays for distinct VMs use the \ :java:ref:`setVmDestructionDelayFunction(Function)`\  method.

   :param delay: the time (in seconds) to wait before destroying idle VMs

   **See also:** :java:ref:`.DEF_VM_DESTRUCTION_DELAY`, :java:ref:`Vm.getIdleInterval()`

setVmDestructionDelayFunction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   Sets a \ :java:ref:`Function`\  to define the delay after which an idle VM should be destroyed. The Function must receive a \ :java:ref:`Vm`\  and return the delay to wait (in seconds), after the VM becomes idle, to destroy it.

   By defining a \ :java:ref:`Function`\  to define when idle VMs should be destroyed enables you to define different delays for every VM that becomes idle, according to desired conditions.

   :param function: the \ :java:ref:`Function`\  to set (if null is given, no idle VM will be automatically destroyed)

   **See also:** :java:ref:`.DEF_VM_DESTRUCTION_DELAY`, :java:ref:`Vm.getIdleInterval()`, :java:ref:`.setVmDestructionDelay(double)`

^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method::  void setVmMapper(Function<Cloudlet, Vm> vmMapper)
   :outertype: DatacenterBroker

   Sets a \ :java:ref:`Function`\  that maps a given Cloudlet to a Vm. It defines the policy used to select a Vm to host a Cloudlet that is waiting to be created.

   :param vmMapper: the Vm mapper Function to set. Such a Function must receive a Cloudlet and return the Vm where it will be placed into. If the Function is unable to find a VM for a Cloudlet, it should return \ :java:ref:`Vm.NULL`\ .
