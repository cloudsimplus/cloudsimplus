Constructors
------------
CloudletReceiveTask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:constructor:: public CloudletReceiveTask(int id, Vm sourceVm)
   :outertype: CloudletReceiveTask

   Creates a new task.

   :param id: task id
   :param sourceVm: the Vm where it is expected to receive packets from

Methods
-------
getNumberOfExpectedPacketsToReceive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public long getNumberOfExpectedPacketsToReceive()
   :outertype: CloudletReceiveTask

   The number of packets that are expected to be received. After this number of packets is received, the task is marked as finished.

getPacketsReceived
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public List<VmPacket> getPacketsReceived()
   :outertype: CloudletReceiveTask

   Gets the list of packets received.

   :return: a read-only received packet list

getSourceVm
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public Vm getSourceVm()
   :outertype: CloudletReceiveTask

   Gets the Vm where it is expected to receive packets from.

receivePacket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public void receivePacket(VmPacket packet)
   :outertype: CloudletReceiveTask

   Receives a packet sent from a \ :java:ref:`CloudletSendTask`\  and add it the the received packet list.

   :param packet: the packet received

setNumberOfExpectedPacketsToReceive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public void setNumberOfExpectedPacketsToReceive(long numberOfExpectedPacketsToReceive)
   :outertype: CloudletReceiveTask
