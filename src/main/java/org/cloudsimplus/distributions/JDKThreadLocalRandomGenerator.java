/**
 * A {@link RandomGenerator} that internally uses the {@link ThreadLocalRandom},
 * a very fast Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
 * with higher performance than {@link java.util.Random}, mainly in concurrent environments.
 * The {@link ThreadLocalRandom} also has
 * much better performance than PRNGs available in {@link org.apache.commons.math3},
 * despite it probably has worse statistical properties.
 *
 * <p>This generator has some drawbacks.
 * It only generates the seed internally and doesn't allow setting an explicit seed.
 * Calling the {@code setSeed()} methods will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 * and there is no way to get the generated seed.
 * This later issue makes it impossible to reproduce a
 * simulation experiment to verify the generated results if the seed is unknown.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, it doesn't allow applying the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithetic_variates">Antithetic Variates Technique</a>
 * in order to try reducing variance of experiments using the generated numbers.
 * Classes such as {@link UniformDistr} provide such a feature if the
 * underlying PRNG allows setting a seed.
 * That is explained because the technique is applied when multiple runs of the same simulation
 * are executed.
 * In such scenario, the second half of experiments have to use the seeds from the first half.
