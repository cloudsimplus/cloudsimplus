/**
 * An interface that represents the provisioning policy used by a {@link Host}
 * to provide a given physical resource to its {@link Vm}s.
 *
 * Each host must have its own instance of a ResourceProvisioner for each
 * {@link Resource} it owns, such as {@link Ram}, {@link Bandwidth} (BW) and {@link Pe} (CPU).

 * @TODO There is a lot of confusion between Resource Allocation and Resource Provisioning.
 *       This article makes it clear: https://www.researchgate.net/post/what_is_the_difference_between_resource_allocation_and_resource_provisioning.
 *       Allocation is reservation, while Provisioning is actual usage of some part of the allocated resource.
 *       When a VM is created, the Host allocates resources, but the Host.allocateResourcesForVm
 *       uses ResourceProvisioners for that. More confusing yet, it calls vmScheduler.allocatePesForVm at the end.
 *       The terms allocation and provisioning sometimes are used in the same place.
 *       The Host.allocateResourcesForVm method has the word "allocate" in its name,
 *       while internally it uses ResourceProvisioners (quite confusing).
 *       VmScheduler is using the term "allocation", but since it's accountable for running a VM,
 *       it should perform resource provisioning (request the actual amount of the allocated resource to be used in that moment).
