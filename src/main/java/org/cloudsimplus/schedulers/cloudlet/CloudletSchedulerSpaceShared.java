/**
 * Implements a policy of scheduling performed by a
 * virtual machine to run its {@link Cloudlet Cloudlets}. It considers there
 * will be only one Cloudlet per VM. Other Cloudlets will be in a waiting list.
 * It also considers that the time to transfer Cloudlets to the Vm happens
 * before Cloudlet starts executing. I.e., even though Cloudlets must wait for
 * CPU, data transfer happens as soon as Cloudlets are submitted.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>This scheduler does not consider Cloudlets priorities to define execution
 * order. If actual priorities are defined for Cloudlets, they are just ignored
 * by the scheduler.</b></p>
