/**
 * Implements a policy of scheduling performed by a
 * virtual machine to run its {@link Cloudlet Cloudlets}. Cloudlets execute in
 * time-shared manner in VM. Each VM has to have its own instance of a
 * CloudletScheduler. <b>This scheduler does not consider Cloudlets priorities
 * to define execution order. If actual priorities are defined for Cloudlets,
 * they are just ignored by the scheduler.</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * It also does not perform a preemption process in order to move running
 * Cloudlets to the waiting list in order to make room for other already waiting
 * Cloudlets to run. It just imposes there is not waiting Cloudlet,
 * <b>oversimplifying</b> the problem considering that for a given simulation
 * second <i>t</i>, the total processing capacity of the processor cores (in
 * MIPS) is equally divided by the applications that are using them.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>In processors enabled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Hyper-threading technology (HT)</a>,
 * it is possible to run up to 2 processes at the same physical CPU core.
 * However, usually just the Host operating system scheduler (a {@link VmScheduler} assigned to a Host)
 * has direct knowledge of HT to accordingly schedule up to 2 processes to the same physical CPU core.
 * Further, this scheduler implementation
 * oversimplifies a possible HT for the virtual PEs, allowing that more than 2 processes to run at the same core.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since this CloudletScheduler implementation does not account for the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch">context switch</a>
 * overhead, this oversimplification impacts tasks completion by penalizing
 * equally all the Cloudlets that are running on the same CPU core.
 * Other impact is that, if there are
 * Cloudlets of the same length running in the same PEs, they will finish
 * exactly at the same time. On the other hand, on a real time-shared scheduler
 * these Cloudlets will finish almost in the same time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As an example, consider a scheduler that has 1 PE that is able to execute
 * 1000 MI/S (MIPS) and is running Cloudlet 0 and Cloudlet 1, each of having
 * 5000 MI of length. These 2 Cloudlets will spend 5 seconds to finish. Now
 * consider that the time slice allocated to each Cloudlet to execute is 1
 * second. As at every 1 second a different Cloudlet is allowed to run, the
 * execution path will be as follows:<br>
 *
 * Time (second): 00 01 02 03 04 05<br>
 * Cloudlet (id): C0 C1 C0 C1 C0 C1<br>
 *
 * As one can see, in a real time-shared scheduler that does not define priorities
 * for applications, the 2 Cloudlets will in fact finish in different times. In
 * this example, one Cloudlet will finish 1 second after the other.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING</b>: Time-shared schedulers drastically degrade performance
 * of large scale simulations.</p>
