 * Provides the features to enable a {@link CloudletScheduler} to
 * process internal {@link CloudletTask}s such as:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>processing of {@link CloudletExecutionTask}s;</li>
 *  <li>sending {@link VmPacket}s from the {@link Vm} of the scheduler to other ones;</li>
 *  <li>or receiving {@link VmPacket}s sent from other VMs to that {@link Vm}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The packet dispatching is performed by processing {@link CloudletTask}s

 * <p>A researcher creating its own simulations using CloudSim Plus usually doesn't have to
 * care about this class, since even creating network-enabled simulations using objects
 * such as {@link NetworkDatacenter}, {@link NetworkHost}, {@link NetworkVm}
 * and {@link NetworkCloudlet}, the {@link NetworkHost} will automatically create instances of
 * the current interface and attach each one to the {@link CloudletScheduler}
 * that every Vm is using, doesn't matter what kind of scheduler it is.</p>
