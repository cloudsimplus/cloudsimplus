/**
 * <p>A class that implements the Decorator Design Pattern in order to
 * include features in a existing class.
 * It is used to ensure that specific methods are called only after
 * a given method is called.</p>
 *
 * For instance, the methods {@link #getVmBuilder()} and
 * {@link #getCloudletBuilder()} can only be called after
 * some {@link DatacenterBrokerSimple} was created by calling
 * the method {@link #create()}.<br>
 * By this way, after the method is called, it returns
 * an instance of this decorator that allow
 * chained call to the specific decorator methods
 * as the following example:
 * <ul><li>{@link #create() createBroker()}.{@link #getVmBuilder() getVmBuilder()}</li></ul>
