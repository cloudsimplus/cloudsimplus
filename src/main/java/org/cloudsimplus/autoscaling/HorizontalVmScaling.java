 * A Vm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling">Horizontal Scaling</a>
 * mechanism used by a {@link DatacenterBroker} to dynamically create VMs according to the arrival of
 * Cloudlets, in order to enable load balancing.
 *
 * <p>Since Cloudlets can be created and submitted to a broker in runtime,
 * the number of arrived Cloudlets can be to much to existing VMs,
 * requiring the creation of new VMs to balance the load.
 * A HorizontalVmScaling implementation performs
 * such up scaling by creating VMs as needed.</p>
 *
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * To enable horizontal down scaling to destroy idle VMs, the {@link DatacenterBroker} has to be used
 * by setting a {@link DatacenterBroker#setVmDestructionDelayFunction(Function)}.
 * Since there is no Cloudlet migration mechanism (and it isn't intended to have),
 * if a VM becomes underloaded, there is nothing that can be done until all Cloudlets
 * finish executing. When that happens, the vmDestructionDelayFunction
 * will handle such a situation.
