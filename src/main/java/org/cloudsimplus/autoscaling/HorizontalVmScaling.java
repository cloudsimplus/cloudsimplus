/// Since Cloudlets can be created and submitted to a broker in runtime,

/// To enable horizontal down-scaling to destroy idle VMs, the [DatacenterBroker] has to be used

/// if a VM becomes underloaded, there is nothing that can be done until all Cloudlets
/// finish executing. When that happens, the vmDestructionDelayFunction
/// will handle such a situation.
