/**
 * A Vm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling">Vertical Scaling</a>
 * mechanism used by a {@link DatacenterBroker} to request the dynamic scale of
 * VM resources up or down, according to the current resource usage.
 * For each resource supposed to be scaled, a different {@code VerticalVmScaling}
 * instance should be provided.
 * If a scaling object is going to be set to a Vm, it has to be exclusive of that Vm.
 * Different Vms must have different instances of a scaling object.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Vm} runs a set of {@link Cloudlet}s. When a {@code VerticalVmScaling} object
 * is attached to a {@link Vm}, it's required to define which
 * {@link #getResourceClass() resource will be scaled} ({@link Ram}, {@link Bandwidth}, etc)
 * when it's {@link #getLowerThresholdFunction() under} or
 * {@link #getUpperThresholdFunction() overloaded}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     The scaling request follows this path:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>a {@link Vm} that has a {@link VerticalVmScaling} object set monitors its own
 *         resource usage using an {@link EventListener}, to check if an
 *         {@link #getLowerThresholdFunction() under} or
 *         {@link #getUpperThresholdFunction() overload} condition is met;</li>
 *         <li>if any of these conditions is met, the Vm uses the VerticalVmScaling
 *         to send a scaling request to its {@link DatacenterBroker};</li>
 *         <li>the DatacenterBroker forwards the request to the {@link Datacenter}
 *         where the Vm is hosted;</li>
 *         <li>the Datacenter delegates the task to its {@link VmAllocationPolicy};</li>
 *         <li>the VmAllocationPolicy checks if there is resource availability and then
 *         finally scale the Vm.</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>WARNING</h1>
 * <hr>
 *    Make sure that the {@link UtilizationModel} of some of these {@code Cloudlets}
 *    is defined as {@link Unit#ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE}. Defining the {@code UtilizationModel}
 *    of all {@code Cloudlets} running inside the {@code Vm} as {@link Unit#PERCENTAGE PERCENTAGE}
 *    causes these {@code Cloudlets} to automatically increase/decrease their resource usage when the
 *    {@code Vm} resource is vertically scaled.
 *    This is not a CloudSim Plus issue, but the natural and maybe
 *    surprising effect that may trap researchers trying to implement and assess VM scaling policies.
 *
 *    <p>Consider the following example: a {@code VerticalVmScaling} is attached to
 *    a {@code Vm} to double its {@link Ram} when its usage reaches 50%.
 *    The {@code Vm} has 10GB of RAM.
 *    All {@code Cloudlets} running inside this {@code Vm} have a {@link UtilizationModel}
 *    for their RAM utilization define in {@link Unit#PERCENTAGE PERCENTAGE}.
 *    When the RAM utilization of all these
 *    {@code Cloudlets} reach the 50% (5GB), the {@code Vm} {@link Ram} will be doubled.
 *    However, as the RAM usage of the running {@code Cloudlets} is defined in percentage, they will
 *    continue to use 50% of {@code Vm}'s RAM, that now represents 10GB from the 20GB capacity.
 *    This way, the vertical scaling will have no real benefit.</p>
