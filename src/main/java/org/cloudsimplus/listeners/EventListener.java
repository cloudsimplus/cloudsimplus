/**
 *
 * An interface to define Observers (Listeners) that listen to specific changes in
 * the state of a given observable object (Subject).
 * By this way, the EventListener gets notified when
 * the observed object has its state changed.
 *
 *
 * <p>The interface was defined allowing the Subject object to have more than one state
 * to be observable. If the subject directly implements
 * this interface, it will allow only one kind of state change to be observable.
 * If the Subject has multiple state changes to be observed,
 * it can define multiple EventListener attributes
 * to allow multiple events to be observed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Such Listeners are used for many simulation entities such as {@link Vm} and {@link Cloudlet}.
 * Check the documentation of such interfaces that provides some Listeners.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> The class of the object containing information to be given to the
 * listener when the expected event happens.
