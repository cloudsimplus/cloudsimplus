 * Each enum instance is a possible value for the {@link MachineEventField#EVENT_TYPE} field.
 *
 * <p>This enum defines a some methods to move the processing logic of each event type
 * to the enum value associated to it. Since the enum includes the {@link #process(GoogleMachineEventsTraceReader)}
 * abstract method, if a new enum value is added, we just need to implement the method for that value.
 * Using such approach we avoid spreading if chains to check which event type a trace line is
 * to call the corresponding process method.</p>
