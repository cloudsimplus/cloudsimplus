 * A data class to store the attributes to create a {@link Host},

 * Instance of this class are created by the {@link GoogleMachineEventsTraceReader}
 * and provided to the user's simulation.
 *
 * <p>In order to create such Hosts, the {@link GoogleMachineEventsTraceReader} requires
 * the developer to provide a {@link Function}
 * that creates Hosts according to the developer needs.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link GoogleMachineEventsTraceReader} cannot create the Hosts itself
 * by hard-coding some simulation specific parameters such as the {@link VmScheduler}
 * or {@link ResourceProvisioner}. This way, it request a {@link Function} implemented
 * by the developer using the {@link GoogleMachineEventsTraceReader} class
 * that has the custom logic to create Hosts.
 * However, this developer's {@link Function} needs to receive
 * the host parameters read from the trace file.
 * To avoid passing so many parameters to the developer's
 * Function, an instance of this class that wraps all these
 * parameters is used instead.</p>
