/**
 * An interface which defines the desired functionality of a storage system in a Data Cloud
 * that performs operations on a file system, such as file inclusion, exclusion
 * and renaming.
 * Classes that implement this interface should simulate the characteristics of different storage
 * systems by setting the capacity of the storage and the maximum transfer rate. The transfer rate
 * defines the time required to execute some common operations on the storage, e.g. storing a file,
 * getting a file and deleting a file.
