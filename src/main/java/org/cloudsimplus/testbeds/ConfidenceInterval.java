     * <p>
     * To reduce the confidence interval by half, one have to execute the

     *
     * <b>NOTE:</b> How to compute the error margin is a little confusing.
     * The Harry Perros' book states that if less than 30 samples are collected,
     * the t-Distribution has to be used to that purpose.
     *
     * However, this
     * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval#Basic_Steps">Wikipedia
     * article</a>
     * says that if the standard deviation of the real population is known, it
     * has to be used the z-value from the Standard Normal Distribution.
     * Otherwise, it has to be used the t-value from the t-Distribution to
     * calculate the critical value for defining the error margin (also called
     * standard error). The book "Numeric Computation and Statistical Data
     * Analysis on the Java Platform" confirms the last statement and such
     * approach was followed.
