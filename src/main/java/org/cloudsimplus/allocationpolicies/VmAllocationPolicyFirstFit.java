/**
 * A <b>First Fit VM allocation policy</b>
 * which finds the first Host having suitable resources to place a given VM.
 * This is a high time-efficient policy with a best-case complexity O(1)
 * and a worst-case complexity O(N), where N is the number of Hosts.
 * Additionally, such a policy is resource efficient, because it performs
 * server consolidation by trying to place the maximum number of VMs
 * into the same Host in order to increase Host's resource usage.
 *
 * <p>
 *     <b>NOTES:</b>
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>This policy doesn't perform optimization of VM allocation by means of VM migration.</li>
 *         <li>It has a low computational complexity but may return
 *         and inactive Host that will be activated, while there may be active Hosts
 *         suitable for the VM.</li>
 *     </ul>
