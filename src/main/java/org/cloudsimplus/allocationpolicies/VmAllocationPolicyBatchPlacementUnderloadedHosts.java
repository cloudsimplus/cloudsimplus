/**
 * Alocates one different underloaded Host for each submitted VM from a List (in batch),
 * if {@link DatacenterBroker#isBatchVmCreation()} is true, so that
 * the broker sends a List of VMs to be created in a single event
 * (instead of sending a new event for each VM to be created).
 *
 * <p>If that is not enabled this implementation will place VMs one-by-one
 * following the {VmAllocationPolicyMigrationFirstFitStaticThreshold}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation is similar to {@link VmAllocationPolicyRoundRobin},
 * but is selects active and underloaded Hosts first, then performs selection
 * of Host to place a list of VMs in order to reduce the underload state of various Hosts at once.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This may not be the most reasoanable policy and is provided
 * just as an example on how to implement a different policy for batch VM creation
 * when the related broker attribute is enabled.</p>
