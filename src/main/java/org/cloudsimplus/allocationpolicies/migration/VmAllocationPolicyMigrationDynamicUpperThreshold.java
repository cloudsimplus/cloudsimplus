     * It is a tuning parameter used by the allocation policy to define
     * when a host is overloaded. The overload detection is based
     * on a dynamic defined host utilization threshold.
     *
     * <p>Such a threshold is computed based on the host's usage
     * history using different statistical methods
     * (such as Median absolute deviation - MAD, that is similar to the Standard Deviation)
     * depending on the implementing class, as defined by the method
     * {@link #computeHostUtilizationMeasure(Host)}.</p>
     *
     * <p>
     * This safety parameter is used to increase or decrease the utilization threshold.
     * As the safety parameter increases, the threshold decreases,
     * what may lead to less SLA violations. So, as higher is that parameter,
     * safer the algorithm will be when defining a host as overloaded.
     * <b>A value equal to 0 indicates that the safety parameter doesn't affect
     * the computed CPU utilization threshold.</b>
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>Let's take an example of a class that uses the MAD to compute the
     * over utilization threshold. Considering a host's resource usage mean of 0.6 (60%)
     * and a MAD of 0.2, meaning the usage may vary from 0.4 to 0.8.
     * Now take a safety parameter of 0.5 (50%).
     * To compute the usage threshold, the MAD is increased by 50%, being equals to 0.3.
     * Finally, the threshold will be 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.
     * Thus, only when the host utilization threshold exceeds 70%,
     * the host is considered overloaded.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Here, safer doesn't mean a more accurate overload detection but that the
     * algorithm will use a lower host
     * utilization threshold that may lead to lower SLA violations but higher
     * resource wastage. <b>Thus this parameter has to be tuned in order to
     * trade-off between SLA violation and resource wastage.</b></p>
