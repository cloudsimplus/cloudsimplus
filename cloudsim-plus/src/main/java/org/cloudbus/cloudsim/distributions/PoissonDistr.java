     * Calling this method for the first time returns the next event arrival time.
     * The retuning values for consecutive calls can be dealt in one of the following ways:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>
     *   If you are generating all random event arrivals at the beginning of the simulation,
     *   you need to add the previous time to the next event arrival time.
     *   This way, the arrival time of the previous event is added to the next one.
     *   For instance, if consecutive calls to this method return the values 60 and 25, from the current time, that means:
     *       (i) the first event will arrive in 60 seconds;
     *       (ii) the next event will arrive in 85 seconds, that is 25 seconds after the first one.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *   If you are generating event arrivals during simulation runtime,
     *   you must NOT add the previous time to the generated event time,
     *   just use the returned value as the event arrival time.
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
