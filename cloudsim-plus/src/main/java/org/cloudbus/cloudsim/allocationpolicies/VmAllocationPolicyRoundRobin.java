/**
 * A <b>Round-Robin VM allocation policy</b>
 * which finds the next Host having suitable resources to place a given VM
 * in a circular way. That means when it selects a suitable Host to place a VM,
 * it moves to the next suitable Host when a new VM has to be placed.
 * This is a high time-efficient policy with a best-case complexity O(1)
 * and a worst-case complexity O(N), where N is the number of Hosts.
 *
 * <p>
 *     <b>NOTES:</b>
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>This policy doesn't perform optimization of VM allocation by means of VM migration.</li>
 *         <li>It has a low computational complexity (high time-efficient) but may return
 *         and inactive Host that will be activated, while there may be active Hosts
 *         suitable for the VM.</li>
 *         <li>Despite the low computational complexity, such a policy will increase the number of active Hosts,
 *         that increases power consumption.</li>
 *     </ul>
