 * @TODO @author manoelcampos For how long will the task be waiting for packets?
 * The sender task has a defined amount of packets to send, but
 * the receiver doesn't have to know how many packets to wait for.
 * Considering a real distributed app such as a web app, the sender can be
 * a browser and the receiver a web server. In this case,
 * the web server runs indefinitely. However, the simulation
 * has to have a time interval. For instance, it may be simulated
 * the operation of this distributed app for 24 hours.
 * By this way, the receiver task could have a specific amount
 * of time to run. In the web app scenario, the web server just
 * keep running, waiting for any client to send packets to it,
 * but it is not required that a client do that. The web app
 * may not be accessed during this time.
 * By other hand, the client may send packets to the server
 * and require a response. It will so wait for this response
 * and has to have a timeout period so that the client can
 * skip waiting to receive an answer and move to the next task
 * or finish.
 *
 * Each task has to have a status (such as the Cloudlet itself)
 * to define if it was executed successfully or not.
 * For instance, a receive ask that is waiting to receive
 * a list of packets can be configured to finish
 * after a given timeout without receiving the expected packets.
 *
 * How is the network delay being computed?
