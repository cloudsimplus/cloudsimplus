/**
 * A base class for implementation of
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">Simulated Annealing</a>
 * algorithms used to find a suboptimal solution for a problem defined by sub-classes of this one.
 *
 * The Simulated Annealing is a heuristic that starts with a random solution
 * and iteratively generates a random neighbor solution that its fitness
 * is assessed in order to reach a sub-optimal result.
 * The algorithm try to avoid local maximums, randomly selecting
 * worse solutions to get away from being stuck in these locals.
 *
 * <p>The algorithm basically works as follows:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Starts generating a random solution as you wish;</li>
 *  <li>Computes its fitness using some function (defined by the developer implementing the heuristic);</li>
 *  <li>Generates a neighbor random solution from the current solution and computes its fitness;</li>
 *  <li>Assesses the neighbor and current solution (the conditions below are ensured by the {@link #getAcceptanceProbability()} method):
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>{@code if neighbor.getFitness() > current.getFitness()} then move to the new solution;</li>
 *          <li>{@code if neighbor.getFitness() < current.getFitness()} then randomly decide if move to the new solution;</li>
 *      </ul>
 *  </li>
 *  <li>Repeat steps 3 to 4 until an aceptable solution is found or some number
 * of iterations or time is reached. These conditions are defined by the developer
 * implementing the heuristic.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <S> the class of solutions the heuristic will deal with, starting with a random solution
 *           and execute the solution search in order to achieve a satisfying solution (defined by a stop criteria)
