/**
 * A general interface that represents data to be passed to
 * {@link EventListener} objects that are registered to be notified when some
 * events happen for a given simulation entity such as a
 * {@link Datacenter}, {@link Host}, {@link Vm}, {@link Cloudlet} and so on.
 *
 * <p>
 * There is not implementing class for such interfaces because instances of them
 * are just Data Type Objects (DTO) that just store data and do not have
 * business rules. Each interface that extends this one has a
 * {@code getInstance()} method to create an object from that interface. Such
 * method uses the JDK8 static methods for interfaces to provide such a feature
 * e reduce the number of classes, providing a simpler design.
