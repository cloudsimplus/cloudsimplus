/**
 * Generates random failures for the {@link Pe}'s of {@link Host}s
 * inside a given {@link Datacenter}.
 * A Fault Injection object
 * usually has to be created after the VMs are created,
 * to make it easier to define a function to be used
 * to clone failed VMs.
 *
 * <p>
 * The events happens in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>a time to inject a Host failure is generated using a given Random Number Generator;</li>
 *  <li>a Host is randomly selected to fail at that time using an internal
 *  Uniform Random Number Generator with the same seed of the given generator;</li>
 *  <li>the number of Host PEs to fail is randomly generated using the internal generator;</li>
 *  <li>failed physical PEs are removed from affected VMs, VMs with no remaining
 *  PEs and destroying and clones of them are submitted to the {@link DatacenterBroker}
 *  of the failed VMs;</li>
 *  <li>another failure is scheduled for a future time using the given generator;</li>
 *  <li>the process repeats until the end of the simulation.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When Host's PEs fail, if there are more available PEs
 * than the required by its running VMs, no VM will be affected.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Considering that X is the number of failed PEs and it is
 * lower than the total available PEs.
 * In this case, the X PEs will be removed cyclically, 1 by 1,
 * from running VMs.
 * This way, some VMs may continue running
 * with less PEs than they requested initially.
 * On the other hand, if after the failure the number of Host working PEs
 * is lower than the required to run all VMs, some VMs will be
 * destroyed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If all PEs are removed from a VM, it is automatically destroyed
 * and a snapshot (clone) from it is taken and submitted
 * to the broker, so that the clone can start executing
 * into another host. In this case, all the cloudlets
 * which were running inside the VM yet, will be
 * cloned to and restart executing from the beginning.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a cloudlet running inside a VM which was affected by a PE failure
 * requires Y PEs but the VMs doesn't have such PEs anymore,
 * the Cloudlet will continue executing, but it will spend
 * more time to finish.
 * For instance, if a Cloudlet requires 2 PEs but after the failure
 * the VM was left with just 1 PE, the Cloudlet will spend the double
 * of the time to finish.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTES:</b>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *      Host PEs failures may happen after all its VMs have finished executing.
 *      This way, the presented simulation results may show that the
 *      number of PEs into a Host is lower than the required by its VMs.
 *      In this case, the VMs shown in the results finished executing before
 *      some failures have happened. Analysing the logs is easy to
 *      confirm that.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>Failures inter-arrivals are defined in minutes, since seconds is a too
 *      small time unit to define such value. Furthermore, it doesn't make sense to define
 *      the number of failures per second. This way, the generator of failure arrival times
 *      given to the constructor considers the time in minutes, despite the simulation
 *      time unit is seconds. Since commonly Cloudlets just take some seconds to finish,
 *      mainly in simulation examples, failures may happen just after the cloudlets
 *      have finished. This way, one usually should make sure that Cloudlets' length
 *      are large enough to allow failures to happen before they end.
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
