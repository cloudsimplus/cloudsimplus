/**
 *
 * An interface to define observer objects that listen to specific changes in 
 * the state of a given observable object, also called subject. 
 * By this way, the EventListener gets notified when
 * the observed object has its state changed.
 * The interface was defined allowing the
 * subject object to have more than one state
 * to be observable. If the subject directly implements
 * this interface, it will allow only one kind of
 * state change to be observable.
 * If the subject has multiple state changes to be observed,
 * it can define multiple properties of the EventListener class
 * to allow this multiple events to be observable.
 * See interfaces such as {@link org.cloudbus.cloudsim.Vm}
 * to get an overview of how this interface can be used.
