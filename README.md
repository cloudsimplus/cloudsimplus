[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/manoelcampos/cloudsim/cloudsim-4.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/manoelcampos/cloudsim) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/manoelcampos/cloudsim/badge.svg?branch=cloudsim-4)](https://coveralls.io/github/manoelcampos/cloudsim?branch=cloudsim-4) [![LGPL licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-LGPL-blue.svg)](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim/tree/cloudsim-4/LICENSE)


# NOTICE

This is a **unofficial proposed CloudSim 4.0** version thas is based on CloudSim 3.0.3 and **IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE** with such main release (despite simulations using the official version can relatively easy be ported to this new version using some IDE such as NetBeans). CloudSim is divided in some maven projects that are all provided when you download the source code. The [cloudsim-examples](modules/cloudsim) project, that represents the Cloud Simulation API, now requires the JDK 8 and makes intensive use of new Java 8 features such as [Lambda Expressions, Streams and Functional Programming](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html). However, [cloudsim-examples](modules/cloudsim-examples) project were updated just from Java 6 to 7 in order to provide yet simple examples for beginner Java programmers, but less verbose code than Java 6. 

This proposed 4.0 version is in beta stage yet and is mainly focused on refactorings to reduce code duplication, increase usage of 
software engeneering standards and recommendations such as [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/SOLID %28object-oriented_design%29) and other ones such as [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) in order to provide:
- cleaner code that is easier to understand and maintain
- more meaningful classes and method names
- division of very long and confuse methods into small, clean and very meaningful ones that usually makes just one thing
- increased reausability and facility for extension
- improved class hiearchy 

It also includes:

- functional/integration tests using JUnit in order to test how a set of classes works together and even overall simulation scenarios
- continuous integration using [Travis](http://travis-ci.org) services (see the badge at the top of this file)
- inclusion of Maven Coverage Plugin to starting tracking the percentage of code that is being coverage by unit tests
- inclusion of public code coverage report using [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io) services (see the badge at the top of this file). The code coverage raised from 20% to [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/manoelcampos/cloudsim/badge.svg?branch=cloudsim-4)](https://coveralls.io/github/manoelcampos/cloudsim?branch=cloudsim-4)
- new concise and easy to understand examples of features that have lots of questions at the Google Groups forum, such as dynamic creation of cloudlets based on workload traces; VM migration; and definition of new DatacenterBroker's, VmScheduler's and CloudletScheduler's
- creation of new packages and reorganization of classes 
- bug fixes
- improved and completely updated and clearer documentation
- inclusion of new set of features.

As this release gets a stable stage, it will be performed a pull request to the official CloudSim repository in order to try make this official.
Thus, this version is being earlier released to the community in order to get feedback such as suggestions and bug reports.

For more information about the changes and features included in this release, please read the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file and the [cloudsim-examples](modules/cloudsim-examples) project.

# INTRODUCTION

Cloud computing is the leading technology for delivery of reliable, secure, fault-tolerant, sustainable, and scalable computational services.

For assurance of such characteristics in cloud systems under development, it is required timely, repeatable, and controllable methodologies for evaluation of new cloud applications and policies before actual development of cloud products. Because utilization of real testbeds limits the experiments to the scale of the testbed and makes the reproduction of results an extremely difficult undertaking, simulation may be used.

CloudSim goal is to provide a generalized and extensible simulation framework that enables modeling, simulation, and experimentation of emerging Cloud computing infrastructures and application services, allowing its users to focus on specific system design issues that they want to investigate, without getting concerned about the low level details related to Cloud-based infrastructures and services.

CloudSim is developed in [the Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory](http://cloudbus.org/), at [the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/) of [the University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).

CloudSim is powered by [jProfiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).
