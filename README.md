CloudSim Plus is a modern, up-to-date, full-featured and fully documented **Java 17** simulation framework. It's easy to use and extend, enabling modeling, simulation, and experimentation of Cloud computing infrastructures and application services. 
It allows developers to focus on specific system design issues to be investigated, without concerning the low-level details related to Cloud-based infrastructures and services.
 
CloudSim Plus is a fork of CloudSim 3, re-engineered primarily to avoid code duplication, provide [code reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse) and ensure compliance with software engineering principles and recommendations for extensibility improvements and accuracy. It's currently the state-of-the-art in cloud computing simulation framework. 

The efforts dedicated to this project have been recognized by the [EU/Brasil Cloud FORUM](https://eubrasilcloudforum.eu). 
A post about CloudSim Plus is available at 
[this page of the Forum](https://eubrasilcloudforum.eu/en/instituto-federal-de-educação-do-tocantins-brazil-instituto-de-telecomunicações-portugal-and), including a White Paper available in the [Publications Section](#publications).

CloudSim Plus started through a partnership between the [Instituto de Telecomunicações (IT, Portugal)](http://www.it.pt), 
the [Universidade da Beira Interior (UBI, Portugal)](http://www.ubi.pt) 
and the [Instituto Federal de Educação Ciência e Tecnologia do Tocantins (IFTO, Brazil)](http://www.ifto.edu.br). 
It was partially supported by the Portuguese [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)](https://www.fct.pt) 
and by the [Brazilian foundation Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)](http://www.capes.gov.br).

> **Note**
> If you are using CloudSim Plus in your research, please make sure you cite this paper: M. C. Silva Filho, R. L. Oliveira, C. C. Monteiro, P. R. M. Inácio, and M. M. Freire. [CloudSim Plus: a Cloud Computing Simulation Framework Pursuing Software Engineering Principles for Improved Modularity, Extensibility and Correctness,](https://doi.org/10.23919/INM.2017.7987304) in IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, 2017, p. 7.

**IMPORTANT**
---
- Developing and maintaining this project takes a huge effort. This way, any kind of [contribution](#contributing) is encouraged. Show your support by giving it a star :star: using the button at the top of the GitHub page. It takes no time, helps promoting the project and keeps it evolving. Thanks in advance :clap:.
- If you are not intending to make changes and contribute back to the project, you shouldn't fork it. Your fork become obsolete as the project is updated. 
- If you're willing to use the framework to develop your own project on top of it, creating a fork is the worst way. You aren't supposed to change the framework code to implement your project, but to extend it by creating some subclasses. Unless you are planning to contribute your changes back, you'll end up with an incompatible and obsolete version of the framework. The project is constantly evolving and bugfixes are a priority. Your fork with personal changes will miss those updates and high performance improvements.

# 2. Main Exclusive Features 🧰

CloudSim Plus provides lots of exclusive features, from the most basic ones to build simple simulations, 
to advanced features for simulating more realistic cloud scenarios: 

1. It is easier to use. [A complete and easy-to-understand simulation scenario can be built in few lines of code.](#example)
2. Multi-cloud simulations with inter-datacenter VM migrations ([#361](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/361)).

13. Create [simulations](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/traces/google) from [Google Cluster Data](https://github.com/google/cluster-data/blob/master/ClusterData2011_2.md) 
    trace files. ([#149](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/149)).
14. Strongly object-oriented, allowing chained calls such as `cloudlet.getVm().getHost().getDatacenter()` without even worrying about `NullPointerException` ([#10](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/10)).
15. Classes and interfaces for implementing [heuristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) such as [Tabu Search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search), [Simulated Annealing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing), [Ant Colony Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) and so on ([example here](/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/brokers/DatacenterBrokerHeuristicExample.java)).
16. [Implementation of the Completely Fair Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler) used in recent versions of the Linux Kernel ([example here](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/schedulers/LinuxCompletelyFairSchedulerExample.java)) ([#58](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/58)).
17. [Host Fault Injection and Recovery Mechanism](/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/HostFaultInjectionExample1.java) to enable injection of random failures into Hosts CPU cores and replication of failed VMs ([#81](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/81)).
18. [Creation of Hosts at Simulation Runtime](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/dynamic/DynamicHostCreation.java) to enable physical expansion of Datacenter capacity ([#124](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/124)).
19. [Enables the simulation to keep running, waiting for dynamic and even random events such as the arrival of Cloudlets and VMs](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/dynamic/KeepSimulationRunningExample.java) ([#130](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/130)).
20. TableBuilder objects that are used in all examples and enable printing simulation results in different formats such as Markdown Table, CSV or HTML.
21. Colors log messages and enables filtering the level of messages to print ([#24](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/24)). ![](docs/images/log-messages-by-type.png) If you want to just see messages from warning level, call `Log.setLevel(ch.qos.logback.classic.Level.WARN);`
22. [Enables running the simulation synchronously, making it easier to interact with it and collect data inside a loop, as the simulation goes on](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/synchronous/SynchronousSimulationExample1.java). This brings freedom to implement your simulations ([#205](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/205)).
23. [Allows placing a group of VMs into the same Host.](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/VmGroupPlacementExample1.java) ([#90](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/issues/90)).

# 3. Project's Structure 🏗

CloudSim Plus has a simpler structure to make it ease to use and understand. It consists of 4 modules, 2 of which are new, as presented below.

![CloudSim Plus Modules](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/raw/master/docs/images/modules.png)

- cloudsimplus (this module): the CloudSim Plus cloud simulation framework API, which is used by all other modules. 
  It is the main and only required module you need to write cloud simulations. 
- [cloudsimplus-examples](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples): includes a series of different examples, since minimal simulation scenarios using basic 
  CloudSim Plus features, to complex scenarios using workloads from trace files or Vm migration examples. This is an excellent starting point for learning how to build cloud simulations using CloudSim Plus.
- [cloudsimplus-testbeds](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-testbeds): enables implementation of simulation testbeds in a repeatable manner, 
  allowing a researcher to execute several simulation runs for a given experiment and collect statistical data using a scientific approach. 
- [cloudsimplus-benchmarks](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-benchmarks): a new module used just internally to implement micro benchmarks to assess framework performance.

It also has a better package organization, 
improving [Separation of Concerns (SoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) 
and making it easy to know where a desired class is and what is inside each package. 
The figure below presents the new package organization. 
The dark yellow packages are new in CloudSim Plus and include its exclusive interfaces and classes. 
The light yellow ones were introduced just to better organize existing CloudSim classes and interfaces.

# 5. A Minimal but Complete Simulation Example ⚙️

In order to build a simulation scenario, you have to create at least:
 
- a datacenter with a list of physical machines (Hosts); 
- a broker that allows submission of VMs and Cloudlets to be executed, on behalf of a given customer, into the cloud infrastructure; 
- a list of customer's virtual machines (VMs); 
- and a list of customer's cloudlets (objects that model resource requirements of different applications).

Due to the simplicity provided by CloudSim Plus, all the code to create a minimal simulation scenario can be as simple as presented below.
A more adequate and reusable example is available
[here](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/BasicFirstExample.java),
together with other ones available in the [cloudsimplus-examples](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples) repository. 

```java
//Enables just some level of logging.
//Make sure to import org.cloudsimplus.util.Log;
//Log.setLevel(ch.qos.logback.classic.Level.WARN);

//Creates a CloudSimPlus object to initialize the simulation.
var simulation = new CloudSim();

//Creates a Broker that will act on behalf of a cloud user (customer).
var broker0 = new DatacenterBrokerSimple(simulation);

//Host configuration
long ram = 10000; //in Megabytes
long storage = 100000; //in Megabytes
long bw = 100000; //in Megabits/s
        
//Creates one host with a specific list of CPU cores (PEs).
//Uses a PeProvisionerSimple by default to provision PEs for VMs
//Uses ResourceProvisionerSimple by default for RAM and BW provisioning
//Uses VmSchedulerSpaceShared by default for VM scheduling
var host0 = new HostSimple(ram, bw, storage, List.of(new PeSimple(20000)));

//Creates a Datacenter with a list of Hosts.
//Uses a VmAllocationPolicySimple by default to allocate VMs
var dc0 = new DatacenterSimple(simulation, List.of(host0));

//Creates one VM to run applications.
//Uses a CloudletSchedulerTimeShared by default to schedule Cloudlets
var vm0 = new VmSimple(1000, 1);
vm0.setRam(1000).setBw(1000).setSize(1000);

//Creates Cloudlets that represent applications to be run inside a VM.
//UtilizationModel defining the Cloudlets use only 50% of any resource all the time
var utilizationModel = new UtilizationModelDynamic(0.5);
var cloudlet0 = new CloudletSimple(10000, 1, utilizationModel);
var cloudlet1 = new CloudletSimple(10000, 1, utilizationModel);
var cloudletList = List.of(cloudlet0, cloudlet1);

broker0.submitVmList(List.of(vm0));
broker0.submitCloudletList(cloudletList);

/*Starts the simulation and waits all cloudlets to be executed, automatically
stopping when there is no more events to process.*/
simulation.start();

/*Prints the results when the simulation is over
(you can use your own code here to print what you want from this cloudlet list).*/
new CloudletsTableBuilder(broker0.getCloudletFinishedList()).build();
```

The presented results are structured and clear to allow better understanding. 
For example, the image below shows the output for a simulation with two cloudlets (applications).
